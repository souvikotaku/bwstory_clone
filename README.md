# dwstory_clone react native app

I made this app for interview task purpose. Its a clone of the bwstory app on playstore. The frontend is made with react native and expo while the backend is made in node/express/mongo.

2) Do npm install
3) Then npm start
4) A QR code would appear in the terminal, scan it with your expo go app and then it will open on your phone.
